1. Nesting tasks within projects is practical because it allows for more organized data and easier understanding thanks to its structure. Additionally, this allows all task data for a project to be displayed in a single query.

4.1. It failed because the query had three requests, so a composite index was needed.

4.2. To define the composite index, the three fields being filtered (priority, status, createdAt) are needed. When the error appears in the console, it includes a link; this link allows you to create the composite index.

4.3. The same index can only be used if you are going to run queries that involve all three fields (priority, status, createdAt).

6. One solution is to create a collection of user dashboards, in which the aggregated data for each user's tasks is stored.
